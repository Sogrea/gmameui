Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.3
====================================

* New GMAMEUI UI Preferences dialog, and preferences handling. Most preferences
are now saved automatically as they changed (instant apply). The gmameui.ini
file format has been changed, and the dirs.ini file will be made obsolete.

* Add support for OpenGL options, and corresponding Options dialog page (SourceForge feature request 1977184)

* Add support for -effect option (e.g. scanlines). Note that this is hard-coded to a set of pre-defined effects, and doesn't distinguish between available/unavailable effects. The effects .png files need to be placed in the artwork directory

* Various bug fixes and code cleanups

* Setup directory and build structure for Help

* New translations:
    Italian translation (Ugo Viti)
    Brazilian translation (Junix)

* Code cleanup, remove redundant code, fixed some compile/run-time GTK warnings
* Removed Drivers as a filters category for 2 second improvement when starting
