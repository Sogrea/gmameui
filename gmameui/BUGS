Please report any bugs found at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=217857&atid=1041607

To help with diagnosing the problem, please add the following details to any bug reports:

1. The contents of $HOME/.gmameui/gmameui.ini
2. A backtrace of any crash/segfault encountered. To generate a backtrace, compile GMAMEUI as follows:
   ./configure --enable-debug
   make
   make install (as root)

   And then run GMAMEUI with the following command:
   gdb src/gmameui

Known Bugs
----------

* If the Stop button is clicked during auditing, the auditing doesn't stop immediately. It seems to continue until the pipe has finished processing.
* SDLMAME uses a different process to perform the audit, so counting of the total available ROMs can't be performed prior to execution.
  - We could have a lookup table that provides this information.
* In process_audit_romset, a ROM is reported as 'bad' even if the error is just an incorrect length on one of the ROMs

* With the new Options dialog, per-game options are not yet implemented

* Filters list is not finalised, hence a small memory leak
